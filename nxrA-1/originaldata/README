Building a model for nxrA.

Pulled sequences from NCBI:
(narG[gene] OR "nitrate oxidoreductase"[title]) NOT partial[title] NOT beta[title] NOT gamma[title] NOT fragment[title]
and uniprot:
gene:nxra (select only sequences longer than 650aa)

This gets 25 unique sequences, of which 4 were fragments. The remaining 21  were 6 Nitrospira, 5 Planctomycetes (Scalindua, Brocadia), 1 Terrabacteria (Armatimonadetes), 1 NC10, 1 Chloroflexi and 1 Rokubacteria in one cluster and 4 Chloroflexi (Nitrolancea), 1 Archaea (Methanoperedens), 1 gProteo (Thiocapsa) in a second cluster that is actually quite similar to NarG.

This model will be for Nitrospira-like NxrA.

Reduce to just the Nitrospirae-like nxrA sequences. Get rid of gappy (>50%) columns and nr to 85%. Save as the .seeds file and a .sto file.
Build the initial hmm.
$ /home/bifx/hmmer-3.0_xanderpatch/binaries/hmmbuild -n nxrA-1 -o nxrA-1.summary nxrA-1.hmm nxrA-1.trimmed.sto

Build the nucl.fa and framebot.fa files
$ perl /files1/Xander_additions/build_framebot.pl -f nxrA-1.nr.faa

$ /home/bifx/RDPTools/Xander_assembler/bin/prepare_gene_ref.sh nxrA-1

Looking at the ref_aligned.faa, everything looks okay.
